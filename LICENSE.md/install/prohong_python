Applications

System-level research applications are installed in the “/apps” directory. The majority of applications are installed as Singularity containers. We encourage you to install your software in containers. More information can be found here: https://www.sylabs.io/docs/.
 
If you plan to install and use your own software, we recommend and encourage installation into your home directory. example: /data/gpfs/home/yunchuanl/apps
 
Scheduler

Pronghorn uses the Slurm scheduler. All software must be run on the cluster through Slurm. You cannot log into CPU or GPU nodes directly.
