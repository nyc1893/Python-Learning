Email from Zach:


Connect to https://remote.engr.unr.edu

 

Windows Key -> Search for  ‘XLaunch’ -> Execute and accept all the Defaults
Launch Cygwin Terminal then type in the following:
export DISPLAY=:0
ssh -Y $your_cse_id@gpuh.cse.unr.edu
Launch firefox in the background
nohup firefox &
Go through the rclone Box client configuration
choose USER/enterprise for UNR box
choose DEFAULT/remote connect


The problem is A fatal error has occurred and Cygwin/X will now exit.
When open xlaunch, try to use another port (here we use No.10)

xterm??

If there exist an out-dated cofig file then:
rm -rf ~/.config/rclone
