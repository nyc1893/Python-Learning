How to make rpy2 works

tested in Win10 + Rstduio
tested in Linux Gpuh

Runs well in WIn10 + cmd
step1, set envriomental variable
step2, install the packages
install.packages("XX")
Some packages can not install directly
but you need to
e.g.,
install.packages("BiocManager")
BiocManager::install(c("graph", "RBGL"))


I got the demo result:
